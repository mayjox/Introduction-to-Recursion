This is an introduction to recurion with recursive functions written to do a countdown, sum of a range and to determine the factorial of a number

<b>Built with:</b>

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

Recursive functions

recursion pitfalls happen when there is no base case, forget to return or return the wrong thing or stack overflow
